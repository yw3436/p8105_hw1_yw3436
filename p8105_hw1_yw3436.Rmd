# Homework 1

### Problem 1

The following is a data frame that contains

* a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
* a character vector of length 10
* a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

problem1_df = tibble(
  random_num = rnorm(n = 10),
  logic_vec = random_num > 0,
  char_vec = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c", "c"),
  factor_vec = factor(char_vec, c("a", "b", "c"))
)

problem1_df

# Next, we take the mean of the four columns in the data frame.

mean(problem1_df$random_num)
mean(problem1_df$logic_vec)
mean(problem1_df$char_vec)
mean(problem1_df$factor_vec)

```

The results of the mean function shows that the mean of numeric variable and logic vector can be calculated, while character vector and factor vector do not work.
